# Earthquake Visualization using JavaScript
 In this project, the dataset for All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days is obtained from [USGS Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

 We have imported and visualized the data by doing the following:
 1. Using Leaflet, we have created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude
 2. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color
 3. Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked
